## Instructions

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Install [Meslo Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#manual-font-installation) in your host machine.
3. Use the option "Reopen in Container" and open a new zsh terminal. (This might take a while. Grab a coffee, or something).
